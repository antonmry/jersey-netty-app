# jersey-netty-app

This project contains a simple Java-9 based web application built from Jersey and Netty  describing how the application can be packaged in a Docker image that is deployed on a local Kubernetes cluster.

The extensive [tutorial](Tutorial.md) done by Paul Sandoz has been adapted to a workshop format by Ant√≥n R. Yuste to be used with a VM with the following goals: 

- [x] make the workshop available offline
- [x] eliminate problems derived from the environment
- [x] update the tools used with the last versions
